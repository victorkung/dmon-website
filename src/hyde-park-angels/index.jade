      The first deal Mr Monieson led at HPA in 2008 was an investment in Gradebeam,  a pioneer of Software as a Service in the construction industry. Investing in a construction company during the greatest recession in our lifetime was challenging and rewarding. The investment thesis was  that our customers, America’s largest General Contractors, would embrace technology during an economic slowdown to drive down costs and improve efficiencies. Led by an outstanding CEO and a board of industry insiders, we doubled revenues and were acquired in 2011 by Textura Corporation (TXTR) for a 4x return.
